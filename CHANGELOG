## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-14

### Added
- **Dual envelope modes**: Support for both pointwise maximum and wave sum envelopes via `--envelope` flag
- **Envelope-first animation**: Option to show envelope animation before individual waves with `--envelope-first`
- **Interactive pause control**: Pause at key animation points with `--pause` flag
- **Export capabilities**: Save animations as GIF or MP4 files with `--save` option
- **MP4 support**: High-quality video export with ffmpeg (30fps, 1800 bitrate)
- **Dynamic y-axis scaling**: Automatic calculation based on actual envelope values
- **Improved visual feedback**: Warning messages when saving animations
- **Python 3.10+ type hints**: Updated to use modern Python type annotations

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Requires Python 3.10+ (previously 3.8+)
- **Breaking**: `save_gif` parameter replaced with `save_filename` in `run_animation()`
- Y-axis bounds now calculated from actual envelope data for accurate margins
- Envelope type can be selected via `--envelope` flag (max or sum)
- Animation runs twice when saving (once to save, once to display)
- Type hints modernized to Python 3.10+ style (list[] instead of List[], tuple[] instead of Tuple[])

### Fixed
- Y-axis margin now correctly applies to envelope sum calculations
- Canvas preservation during pause (no clearing on resume)
- Typo in pause_keep_display message

### Technical
- Removed legacy typing imports (Tuple, List, Union)
- Improved docstring coverage for all functions
- Better error handling for ffmpeg availability
- Cleaner separation of save and display logic
- Added comprehensive docstrings to all methods
